Cbc0038I Pass   1: (4.03 seconds) suminf.    0.00000 (0) obj. -7012.63 iterations 463
Cbc0038I Solution found of -7012.63
Cbc0038I Relaxing continuous gives -7012.63
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 17668 integers at bound fixed and 15270 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (4.18 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 4.30 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of -7012.63 - took 0.44 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of -7012.6324 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (5.38 seconds)
Cbc0038I Full problem 59293 rows 44744 columns, reduced to 34176 rows 16152 columns - 165 fixed gives 34174, 15987 - still too large
